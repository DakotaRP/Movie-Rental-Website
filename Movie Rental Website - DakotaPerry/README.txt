*About:
-ShowGhost started as a final project for a JavaScript class. The assignment was very basic. I had to make a movie rental website that featured at least 2 categories with 4 movies per category. I had to add mouse rollovers for movie images, pop-up a new window for at least 2 movies when their image was clicked, etc. I thought that the assignment was too basic, so I wanted to add a lot of features and expand on this idea. 
~ShowGhost is a website based on popular movie rental websites such as: Vudu, Redbox, etc. The idea behind ShowGhost is based around a user-friendly rental experience that will continue to evolve over time with added functionality.
